#Incentiviral Android and iOS SDK
The Incentiviral Android and IOS SDKs help devlopers 
- drive engagement in their app
- make their applications viral
- improve the overall buying experience in the app

For example, by using the SDK
- you can generate virality in your app by incentivising app shares on facebook. When users share your app on facebook, you can use this sdk to offer them some kind of discount coupons (virtual good).
- you can drive engagement amongst users by offering in-app currency to users who spend a large amount of time in the app

Example: The LowPrice app using the Incentiviral SDK
